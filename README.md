A simple interface that can record a character's statistics, abilities and inventory. Written in python.

‘Dungeons and Dragons’ style role playing games are fun and engage the imagination. They also
require users to keep track of a constantly changing series of statistics, items and points. It would be
helpful if there was a simple interface that could record a character’s statistics, abilities and
inventory. It would also be helpful if this could be updated easily as the game progresses.

* Health
